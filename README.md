# Intuitive-Study-Of-DDPMs
An attempt to explain how DDPMs work at a higher level to myself.
Unfortunately the math in the md file doesn't render . For those I have included the images of the mathematical expressions in the images folder. 
However , alpha_bar in the image is defined a little differently (I have also included it's defination) so the formulas would look a bit different , but they mostly convey the same idea. Also I did not include much of the mathematical derivations used in the orignal paper as my goal was to make my future self understand the intuition , when required. 

I would be making changes to the repo , as I learn more. 

The latex error was corrected
